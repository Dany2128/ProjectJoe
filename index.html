        The Joe Rogan Experience is a podcast hosted by American comedian and
        UFC color commentator Joe Rogan. It launched on December 24, 2009, on
        YouTube by Rogan and comedian Brian Redban, who was its co-host and
        producer until 2013 when he was replaced by Jamie Vernon. By 2015, it
        was one of the world's most popular podcasts, regularly receiving
        millions of views per episode,also including a wide array of guests.
        Since December 2020, the podcast has been exclusively available on
        Spotify,with highlights uploaded onto the main JRE YouTube channel.The
        podcast originally began in early 2003 when Rogan hired Brian Redban, a
        self-taught video editor and an employee at a Gateway 2000 computer
        store in Ohio, to work for him full-time to film, produce, and edit
        videos for his website.Rogan had noticed video work that Redban did for
        comedian Doug Stanhope and invited him to film him and his group on
        stand-up comedy tours.Redban accepted and relocated to California in the
        process, following Rogan with a camera and "recording everything". After
        several years, Redban noticed that fans were demanding an increasing
        amount of content from Rogan and for it to be delivered faster. This
        prompted the two to seek new ways of quickening what was a lengthy
        editing process to make their website and content more
        interactive.Coupled with his interest in popular live video streaming
        services of the time, Redban wanted "to do the same thing I was filming,
        but live," and set up live streams on Justin.tv from the green room at
        Rogan's various comedy gigs. Redban had no prior experience with audio
        engineering, so he taught himself how to operate the mixing board and
        microphone setups through his subsequent podcasts.Ari Shaffir was the
        podcast's first guest. After some time on Justin.tv, Rogan suggested the
        idea of hosting a live video stream with Redban from his home and
        interacting with fans in a chatroom and on Twitter, with the audio
        portion released as a downloadable podcast. Rogan was influenced by the
        open discussion style from appearing on Opie and Anthony and the live
        Ustream show that co-host Anthony Cumia did from his basement studio,
        Live from the Compound.The first episode aired live on December 24,
        2009,[8] which initially took the form of a weekly broadcast on
        Ustream,with the pair "sitting in front of laptops bullshitting".Much of
        the episode was dead air with the hosts figuring out the equipment.The
        first episodes of the show featured an animated snowflake effect that
        was reintroduced on episode No. 674 in 2015 and episode No. 1,000 in
